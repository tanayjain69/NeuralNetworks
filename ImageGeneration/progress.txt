## Was fascinated by Image Generation by AI, so decided to give it a try myself

# Model V1
    Description - Created a basic DCGAN model learning on a dataset of anime character face images
    Learning details about how that mathematics behind this works and how to make it better
    Added residual connections and logics that I learnt while learning Image Classification

# Model V2
    Description - While figuring out to make this better, learnt a lot more theory like
    hinge loss and other stuff and implemented that in this version (some improvement but not a lot)
