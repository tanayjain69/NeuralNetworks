## Made this project in July-2025

-> Model1
    Stats:
        Basis: Basic linear neural network
        Accuracy: 97.85%
        Complexity: Just 2 linear layers
        Training Time per epoch (my laptop): 17s
    
-> Model2
    Stats:
        Basis: Basic CNN
        Accuracy: 99.26%
        Complexity: 2 linear Layers + 2 Convolution layers
        Training Time per epoch (my laptop): 30s

-> Model3
    Stats:
        Basis: CNN+attention (didn't work out)
        Accuracy: 11.24%
        Complexity: Model2 + attention layer
        Training Time per epoch (my laptop): 150s
        Desc: Too much complication which is apparently not needed for a grayscale simple dataset like MNIST

->Model4
    Stats:
        Basis: Model2 + tuning hyperparameters
        Accuracy: 99.49%
        Complexity: Model2
        Training Time per epoch (my laptop): 28.5s

->Model5
    Stats:
        Basis: Capsule Network
        Accuracy: 
        Complexity: 
        Training Time per epoch (my laptop):
