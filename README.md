# NeuralNetworks
Exploring Neural Networks through PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Projects Involved-

- Created a Neural Network from scratch (vanilla python) -> Created a neural network using just vanilla python and numpy with all the calculations done by hand to understand the mathematics behind neural networks and get a deeper understanding of these models.

- MNIST Dataset prediction model -> Made this Neural Network to predict on the MNIST dataset reaching an accuracy of 99.5% accuracy on the test set.

- CIFAR-10 prediction model -> Learned and experimented a lot of Neural Networks for trying to predict on the CIFAR-10 dataset, learning a lot of new models like- **Basic CNNs**, **Residual Networks(Resnets)**, **DenseNets**, **Inception models**. Learnt data augmentation, dropouts, etc to improve model's stability and reduce overfitting. Learnt how hypertuning parameters affects the model's accuracy.
